## Nilima Akolkar — Data Scientist (Production DS / Applied ML)

I’m a physicist/PhD-turned Data Scientist who likes problems where **data is messy, decisions matter, and “good enough” needs to be measurable**.
My background at CERN shaped how I work: start with a baseline, validate hard, quantify uncertainty, and build workflows that others can trust.

Right now I’m looking for **Data Scientist / Applied ML** roles (production DS or ML) where I can own problems end-to-end: **data → model/analysis → evaluation → delivery**.

## What I’m good at
- Turning noisy real-world data into **decision-ready** metrics and models
- **Validation-first** modeling (leakage checks, time splits, backtests, error analysis)
- Building **robust pipelines** (automation, reproducibility, clear handoffs)
- Handling **uncertainty** (intervals, confidence bounds, risk-aware decisioning)
- Communicating results so stakeholders can act (trade-offs, thresholds, guardrails)

## Featured work
- **Adset profitability scoring (pLTV vs CAC)** — weekly budget steering under incomplete attribution  
  Dynamic 3–8 week lookback + binomial fallback; ~500–1000 adsets/week; contributed to ~20% ROI improvement
